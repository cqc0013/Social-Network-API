## Description

This application was created as the start of a full stack social network application using a MongoDB database, Express.js routing, and the Mongoose ODM. It sets up the initial CRUD API routes for said application which allow users to be created, searched for, updated, and deleted.



## Technologies Used

This application is powered by Node.js, Express.js, JavaScript, MongoDB, and Mongoose (ODM). It utilizes the node package manager (npm) dependencies express, and mongoose. Nodemon was utilized as a Dependency allowing the server to refresh when edits were made to application. Jest is installed as a Dependency for future unit testing. MongoDB Compass acted as the interactive shell used to visually see the database. Also, the Insomnia application, was utilized to test the functionality of routes within the program.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/cqc0013/Social-Network-API.git

2. Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

3. Using the terminal, install node.js 

4. Once node.js is installed, in the terminal, utilize the command npm init -y to initialize and create a package.json where project files will be stored.

5. Next, use the terminal to run the command npm i to install the dependencies associated with this application (developers may need to install dependencies directly from the command line).

   Commands to install each dependency:

   - Command for express will be npm i express
   - Command for mongoose will be npm i mongoose
   - Command for nodemon will be npm i nodemon
   - Command for jest will be npm i jest

6. Next, you will want to make sure you have access to a MongoDB account and MongoDB Compass, these will allow you to interact with the database and visually confirm what changes are being made in the database. (Link for MongoDB & MongoDB Compass download -> https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb).

7. Once all dependencies are installed, you will then be able to run the command npm start from the root directory to spin up the server. With nodemon installed, you will also be able to utilize the command npm run dev to keep the server spun up between code edits.

8. From there, you can utilize applications such as Insomnia to test the functionality of the API routes within the program and make edits to the code base (Link to install Insomnia -> https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/install).
